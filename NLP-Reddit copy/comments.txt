My sister is sickeningly sweet to me because she hates me so much.
That is indeed uncool and you have a bunch of rude people around you :O\n\nBelieve me, as teenager I was one of the "omg girls are SO dramatic I can only hang with boys, less stress" etc.\n\nBut then I grew, met more and more people and without going into all the details, rivalry (can be expressed via judgement) among the female species has deep roots in our pre-civilization past and we allow a lot of animal-instinct behavior into modern times where it is beyond necessary.\n\nAnd as another comment here mentioned similarly, I fully see how many of us female, male, alien etc are feeding into and fostering this nonsense, I do not blame anyone for the origins of this behavior  (there is no point in that) but that we are not actively enough working together on dismantling those cave-women feuds that ultimately result in shady acts like that and worse.

Some women do become emotional wrecks on their period. My hormones go nuts and I am definitely more irritable and tired on my period. 
The only reason I ever know my girlfriend is on her period, is when I try to get busy with her and get shut down. 
Thanks, LOL.\n\nI once had a coworker at a previous job who got really worked up about something and started yelling. People told him to calm down and asked him why he was so angry and he yells angrily "I\

Even if we are wearing them for attention, we usually want attention from a specific person.  
Because some women feel confident and comfortable showing off their body. For instance, I never felt good enough in my body to show it off with revealing clothing until the last couple years, so now I like to show it off every now and then.
That we wear nice or revealing clothes because we are trolling for sex or phone numbers from strangers.

If your daughter is a strong independent young woman, it sounds like you ought to be applauded as well.  
&gt; I believe if men started standing up to other men when things like this happened, it would create a much nicer world for women to be in.\n\nAs the father of a strong, independent young woman, I applaud this sentiment.
Where would a guy go to see rational posts from the female perspective? I used to like jezebel but the last year and really the last 6 months it seems to be all rant and no substance. I lean extremely liberal but I would like a place that at least offer a female perspective with light editorializing or non ranting pov from both sides.

Completely agree. A lot of people see feminists only for the extreme vocal minority. Pretty frustrating. If we worked together we could get so much done.

Not all of us enjoy wearing make-up.
I wear makeup because I am an artist, and my face is a canvas. Plus, eyeliner makes a striking difference.
The same reason I wear a beard. 
As a woman...please do use the necessary amount of force if someone is trying to rape you or hurt you, even if they are a petite woman.  Rapists are scum,  regardless of gender.

Whatever guy you are attracted to, the version of that guy who jogs and goes to the gym twice a week is more attractive.
That we all like muscles and the only way to attract a women is to be very muscular. \n\nDifferent women like different body types. Some like chubby men, some like really heavy set rugby player types, others like lean men, some like thin men. \n 
Or, as someone asserted quite nicely just a bit further up, that when guys call their exes or SOs crazy, they may not be listening. \n\nI mean, I went what most would call "crazy ex," but the dude cheated! Now my name gets dragged through the mud because he fucked another woman for two months. 
That when a relationship (whether its a hook up or long term) goes south, the woman is almost always labeled as "the crazy ex" or whatever. No one ever talks about the men that get all worked up once they\

That we are bad drivers. Ive never been pulled over and never been in an accident. 27 years old. guy said to my husband who parked his car like a retard. Hey did you let your wife park the car? go fuck yourself asshole

That our stereotypes are generated by men. Woman are the biggest generators of them.
Some of us play video games because we actually enjoy them, not to impress you
That being a feminist and wanting equal rights for women is the same as hating men or wanting handouts. 
I hate the stereotype that guys are automatically more laid back than women. Guys are super cool and I love hanging out with them but I hate that it comes at the expense of people assuming women are automatically high maintenance and dramatic. 
That we should cook and clean because thats "our role" in the home. 
In the world of online dating apps, that females are boring to converse with and just expect to be entertained and/or messaged first.\n\nDon\
Do you play WoW? \n\nI played that for 8 years, and not once did a stranger assume I was female. Kind of amusing.

To be fair here, I know a lot of people, both men and women, who want their SO to "figure out" what they want as opposed to telling them.  A lot of people are assholes, after all.
Because there are feelings there is no validity to what I am saying or no logical rationality behind it.
